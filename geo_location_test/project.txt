- US Zip Code
- city name
- geo code

Example is attached - however the example is just one of many.

I'd like the script to accept read from MySQL (I will provide query) and then:

- if there is multiple locations per line
- determine the most accurate (likely geo coordinates) value, but build a full hierarchy please
- geo code each value

Save just one 'source of truth' geo code value into db as lat,lon i.e. -23.788,-34.8888

Thanks!

Python or PHP please. Latest versions. We can install packages if necessary.
